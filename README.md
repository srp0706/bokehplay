# bokehplay
A minimal example of a difficulty I'm having with a pet project.

Run it with `bokeh serve --show sample_annotations.py`.

Upon defining the upper and lower boundaries and pressing the "Draw range" button, a green box should show in the graph, but this does not happen.
Same with defining a value and pressing the "Draw span" button, a red dashed line should appear at the selected height, but that does not happen either.

This very same code used to work on Bokeh 1.0.4.

Indeed it should be mentioned the bokeh library must be installed.
